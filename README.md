## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Development

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PadhaiKarle.git
cd PadhaiKarle
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
You can use your preferred JavaScript package manager to install the necessary dependencies. If you're using \`bun\`, you can install them with:
```bash
bun install
```
### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a \`.env.local\` file in the root directory of your project and populate it with the following environment variables:

```
env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@localhost:5432/<your-db>"
LUCIA_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

```

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret>
```
Replace \`<user>\`, \`<password>\`, \`<your-db>\`, \`<your_google_client_id>\`, and \`<your_google_client_secret>\` with your actual database credentials and Google API keys.
```

### 4. Set Up the Database
Run the following command to set up your database schema:
```bash
bun run db:push
```
### 5. Start the Development Server
To start the development server, run:
```
bash
bun dev
```

The app will be available at \`http://localhost:3000\`.
